# SCAMP-Assessment
My solution to the assessment for my track in Shecode Africa Mentorship
Hello shecode Africa..I really hope I get selected for this mentorship :) ..it's really hard learning on your own and having to struggle with some javascript terms. The benefit of 
having a mentor to guide you can never be over emphasized. I'm more than willing to learn and be active on the slack channel. 
Can't wait to meet so many amazing ladies who share the same passion I have for tech. Above all, thanks for giving me this awesome opportunity to become better :)
